# Description
A **stack** is a special kind of data structure which stores data according to the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle. A stack has two main methods, namely, `Push` and `Pop`. The `Push` adds a new element to the stack, and `Pop` removes the most recently added element from the stack. You can imagine it like a stack of books, or any other item. By using `Push` you add a new item on the top, and by using `Pop` you remove the item at the top. This is the **LIFO** principle.

The program contains a class which implements the Stack data structure, however, it only supports integers. Make changes in the class code so that it is able to support any data type.
